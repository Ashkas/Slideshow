Brief description of how to

1. Image Placement and Insertion

All images that you wish included in the slideshow must be placed in the "image" folder.

The slideshow does not automatically read all images in the "image" folder, rather you need to manually type up each image via both an <img> and <li> tag, within <ul ="slides">.

Here is an example:

<li><img src="images/asics_refreshProduct_FA.png" /></li>

Each line must be customised to link to the images you wish included in the slideshow.

2. Index Page

There are two options for the index page. It can either be a list of links or a page of thumbnail links.

NOTE: The page of thumbnail links only shrinks the images, if there are many links to large images then this will significantly hamper performance.

To switch between the two styles, you must comment in and out the necessary JQuery in js/scripts.js.

To comment out a variation of the pageAnchorBuilder use this mark up:

Before /*
After */

For example, to comment out the page as text links, it would look like this:

/*
pagerAnchorBuilder: function(idx, slide) {
    return '<li><p><a href="#">'
        + jQuery(slide).find('img').attr('src')
        + '</a></p></li>';
*/

The Thumbnail (image) and Text index code is marked in scripts.js. For clarification the code that relates to each style is as follows:

***Thumbnail version***

pagerAnchorBuilder: function(idx, slide) {
    return '<li style="display: block;float: left;width: 120px;height: 120px;overflow: hidden;border: 3px solid #f1f5f6;padding: 4px;"><a href="#"><img src="'
        + jQuery(slide).find('img').attr('src')
        + '" width="120" /></a></li>';

***Text Link Version****

pagerAnchorBuilder: function(idx, slide) {
    return '<li><p><a href="#">'
        + jQuery(slide).find('img').attr('src')
        + '</a></p></li>';

3. IE 7 & 8 Bugs

Just a small note about a bug that affects IE browsers 8 and lower.

The index page is just another <li> item that controls the slideshow. A z-index bug that affects 8 and lower, means that a child tag cannot have a z-index higher than its parent. This means that on the index page you cannot access the links, because the "previous" & "next" layer is in the way.

To work around this problem, the Previous and Next links are placed in a line at the top of the screen for just IE7 & 8.
